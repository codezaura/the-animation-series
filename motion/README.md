# ðŸŽ¬ The Animation Series â€” `motion`

Welcome, fellow builder ðŸ‘‹  
This part of the series is all about **`motion`**, the official animation library from the Framer team â€” built to make React apps come alive with buttery-smooth motion.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Weâ€™re starting clean â€” with a **fresh React app** (powered by `vite` âš¡).

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Then, install the Motion package:

```bash
npm install motion
```

## ðŸ§± Motion Architecture

Weâ€™ll create custom motion components so you donâ€™t have to import `motion` in every single file.

```jsx
// animation.jsx

import { motion } from "motion/react";

export const MotionDiv = motion.create("div");
export const MotionButton = motion.create("button");
```

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Setup Rocks

Normally, youâ€™d write something like this every time:

```jsx
import { motion } from "motion/react";

function Component() {
  return (
    <>
      <motion.div />
      <motion.button>Click</motion.button>
    </>
  );
}
```

But now, with your reusable motion components:

```jsx
import { MotionDiv } from "../components/animation";

function Component() {
  return <MotionDiv />;
}
```

No extra imports. No repeated boilerplate.<br />
Just clean, consistent, and scalable motion components that keep your animation workflow tidy. ðŸ§ âœ¨
